# passwordmanager
This is the prototype version of the password manager I am making for a school project.  
Feel free to take a look at the code and suggest changes.  
I admit I took some things from tutorials and I don't really understand them.  
If you do decide to try and run it make sure you have the modules that are used in the code installed.
