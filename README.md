# passwordmanager

This is the prototype version of the password manager I am making for a school project.  
Feel free to take a look at the code and suggest changes.  
If you do decide to try and run it make sure you have the modules that are used in the code installed.  

I am currently working on increasing the security of the passwords and after that more functionality will be added.
Upcomming functions:
* Search function to find login data.
* Copy password to clipboard (if I can make it work)
* Change password in login data (I forgot that some sites require you to change your pw regularly)
* Random password creator
